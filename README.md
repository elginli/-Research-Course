Tasks from Research Course

Tasks one to three are CPU and GPU functions that take two 3d matrices and we are going to use these two matrices to compute the L2 norm between them, which also results in a 3d matrix of the same size. Then according to the set threshold, we will find which regions are larger than the threshold and set the corresponding regions to 1.

Task one is a basic CPU version just using numpy.
Task two is a faster CPU version using import threading and numpy.
Task three is the fastest and the GPU version using cupy.
